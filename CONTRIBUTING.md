## Bug Reports

When filing an issue, please be as detailed as possible.  While it's not necessary to use the
existing issue template(s), providing as much detail as relevant from the beginning will help
with pinpointing what the issue is.

## Repository Contributions

I'm open to taking contributions primarily for bug fixes and new features.  That doesn't mean
I won't take contributions for other reasons, but stylistic / opinionated matters / spelling
aren't very high on the list of things I care about.

If you've written your own attribute, that's great &mdash; but this repository isn't the place
for attributes created by other authors.  Create your own repository and post about it in the
plugin thread or drop me a line; I'd be happy to include your repo in the appropriate listings.

Before opening a pull request with code, do make sure that it compiles using the build process
described in the "Building" section of the README.  This ensures that you are using the correct
versions of any dependencies present, as they may or may not be the lastest ones available
upstream.  Also, ensure that it builds correctly with the target version(s) specified.

## Licensing
