# Contributing

## Bug Reports

When filing an issue, please be as detailed as possible.  While it's not necessary to use the
existing issue template(s), providing as much detail as relevant from the beginning will help
with pinpointing what the issue is.

## Repository Contributions

I'm open to taking contributions primarily for bug fixes and new features.  That doesn't mean
I won't take contributions for other reasons, but stylistic / opinionated matters / spelling
aren't very high on the list of things I care about.

Before opening a pull request with code, do make sure that it compiles using the build process
described in the "Building" section of the README.  This ensures that you are using the correct
versions of any dependencies present, as they may or may not be the lastest ones available
upstream.  Also, ensure that it builds correctly with the target version(s) specified.

## Licensing

By contributing to this repository, you affirm that all substantial portions submitted are your
own, and that you agree to having your work being published under the MIT license.
